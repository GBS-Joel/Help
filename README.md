# Help

This software can be used to document and create easy to use and find documentation for business or group projects. It has different user interfaces. It is provided as Website and as Desktop app. A mobile app is not in work yet, but will be there in the future. I know that there is maybe a better way to do this but this project is just to learn how to.
